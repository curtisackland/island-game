# Island Game
## Island Game is a 2D top down survival game.

### Description:

Your character spawns on a random island where you need to gather resources to make a boat and escape. On the surface you can gather wood, food, and set up your base in peace. There will be an entrance to a cave on the surface. The cave is where you can obtain stone, metal, coal and fight enemies to get more resources and better weapons to complete the boat.
